# beadLoom
This is a small HSA Console Java project meant to create a bead loom in the style of rotationally symmetrical Indigenous bead looms.

It faces a special constraint, where each 'pixel' must be coded in separately - that is, the only draw command that can be used is a rectangle with a length and width of 10. Then, various loops and if structures must be used to optimize the drawing process of these tiny rectangles to form the full loom.

I completed this project with my partner Maya Peski for the ICS4U course.
